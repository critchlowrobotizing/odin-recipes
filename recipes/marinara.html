            <figcaption> Penne Pasta with a nice Bolognese Sauce</figcaption>
            <p>This Bolognese sauce recipe is my own creation however the credit goes 
                to my girlfriend Marijn and a few italian travelers I met on the road who 
                taught me the balance of a good pasta Sauce. 
            </p> 
            <p> The importance of fresh ingredients and attention to detail cannot be 
                understated. The italians who first showed me a proper pasta recipe in 
                Nicaragua had few ingredients and seasoning, but utilized a few tomatoes, 
                some basil growing at the hostel, and some pasta making techniques that 
                everyone should be required to follow. 
            </p>
            <p> My girlfriend Marijn taught me the veg heavy version of what the italians
                initially taught me. The flavor of red bell peppers, addition of mushrooms 
                and other veggies allows this recipe to be perfect for feeding a hungry 
                village in a delicious and authentic way (hopefull the italians don't 
                hate me for saying this)

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>Based on feeding a hostel of 4 Friends
        <li>Fresh Tomatoes - 6-8 medium sized</li>
        <li> Garlic - 6-8 cloves</li>
        <li> Salt to taste</li>
        <li> Black pepper</li>
        <li> Any good, edible mushroom </li>
        <li> 1 pound of ground beef</li>
        <li> 1-2 large red onion</li>
        <li> 1 large Bell Pepper</li>
        <li> Basil (a good handful at least) </li>
        <li> 1 Zucchini</li>
        <li> Pasta (Angel hair is my favorite)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
<h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure everything is prepped, cut the veggies and have things staged a bit 
            when the cooking starts to move fast</li>
        <li>Heat up the pan with olive oil and once hot, add the ground beef. You can sautee some 
            garlic initially too if you want to flavor the meat a bit. 
        </li>
        <li>Once the meat is browned, remove the beef from the heat and add the rest of your garlic.</li>
        <li>Sautee the garlic for a few seconds in the meat juice and oil, then add the onion and bell 
            pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            Soften the onion and pepper, add some seasoning and salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Add the Zucchini and Mushrooms and some additional seasoning. We want to 
            season throughout the process so each of the ingredients can absorb the 
            seasony goodness.
        </li>
        <li>Our final step will be to add the tomatoes after the mushrooms and Zucchini have
            softened a bit. The tomatoes will need to cook for a bit and cook off some of the 
            water. Keep an eye out for the sauce as you stir and begin to mix everything together. 
        
        </li>
        <li>Final final step will be to cook the pasta and add the ground beef back in. Make sure
            you boil the water in super salty water so its real hot and once you have cooked the 
            pasta, flash it in cold water to keep it from cooking. Then add the ground beef back into
            the sauce and allow as much time on low heat as possible. I usually start this 
            recipe at 3pm so the flavor can absorb for a couple hours after I am done.

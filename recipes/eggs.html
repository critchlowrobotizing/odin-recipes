            <p>Knock out your daily needs of veggies and protein with eggs packed with everything that I consider
                delicious. Cooking eggs can be done in a variety of ways so how exactly you will cook this will
                change and improve based on how you like your eggs.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>Based on feeding 2 Friends
        <li>Fresh Tomatoes </li>
        <li> Garlic </li>
        <li> Salt to taste</li>
        <li> Black pepper</li>
        <li> Any good, edible mushroom </li>
        <li> Chorizo </li>
        <li> 1 large red onion</li>
        <li> 1 large Bell Pepper</li>
        <li> herbs to season </li>
        <li> Avocado (optional)</li>
        <li> Bread or Tortilla</li>
        <li>Jalepeno (optional)</li>
        <li> Eggs</li>
    </ul>
<h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure everything is prepped, cut the veggies and have things staged a bit 
            when the cooking starts to move fast</li>
        <li>Start with the chorizo, cook this down a bit until it is fully cooked. Then sautee 
            the garlic for a few seconds in the meat juice and oil, then add the onion and bell 
            pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            Soften the onion and pepper, add some seasoning and salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and some additional seasoning. We want to 
            season throughout the process so each of the ingredients can absorb the 
            seasony goodness.
        </li>
        <li>Then add the tomatoes after the mushrooms have
            softened a bit. The tomatoes will need to cook for a bit and cook off some of the 
            water. Keep an eye out for the sauce as you stir and begin to mix everything together. 
        
        </li>
        <li>Final step will be to add the eggs. Crack your choice of eggs in and cover with a lid. 
            Be very mindful here as it is easy to over cook your eggs. I always serve with a carb of 
            your choice: toasted bread, tortilla, or hashbrowns. 
        </li>
    </ol>
